Neural Network–Based QSPR Modeling Using Degree-Based Topological Indices for Molecular Weight Prediction


This study investigates whether nonlinear learning can enhance descriptor-based Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship (QSPR) modeling by replacing conventional regression with a feed-forward neural network while keeping all chemical descriptors and dataset construction identical to the benchmark work of Jaganathan et al. (Frontiers in Chemistry, 2025). Using the same six degree-based topological indices — the second Zagreb index (M₂), Randić connectivity index, second-order sum degree (SD²), mean information on the vertex degree (MIR), Schultz topological index (SZ), and molecular hardness (MH) — as molecular descriptors, a compact multilayer perceptron (32–16 ReLU architecture) was trained to predict molecular weight (MW) for a curated set of 16 compounds. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) was employed to ensure unbiased generalization assessment given the limited dataset size.
The neural model achieved a global Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 243.36, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 98.68, and a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.585, indicating that approximately 58.5% of the variance in MW was explained by nonlinear combinations of the six descriptors. Fold-wise performance revealed that prediction accuracy was high for mid-range molecular weights but declined for outlier compounds, reflecting descriptor-space sparsity rather than algorithmic instability. Comparative analysis against linear regression baselines demonstrated that while the neural network captured additional nonlinear interactions among the indices, data scarcity constrained its ability to generalize uniformly.
Post-hoc explainability using permutation importance and partial dependence analysis confirmed M₂ as the dominant predictor, with observed nonlinear synergies involving MIR and SZ. Overall, the results suggest that even a shallow neural architecture can extract latent structure–property interactions overlooked by linear models, supporting the controlled use of neural networks in small-sample QSPR studies and providing a reproducible framework for probing when nonlinearity materially benefits molecular property prediction.
